    Only used on one mission, this experiment measured the particle energies of solar protons and electrons that reach the lunar surface. It provided data on the energy distribution of these solar particles and their effect on the Earth/Moon system, as well as the relationship of the solar wind to Earth auroras; the Van Allen radiation belt; processes taking place at the shock front of the solar wind striking the lunar surface; characteristics of the earth’s magnetic field; and the effect of charged particles on the lunar environment.

    It measured protons and electrons in the energy range of 40,000 to 70,000 electron volts (40 to 70 Kev) and consisted of 2 spectrometer packages oriented for minimum exposure to the Sun’s ecliptic path. Each spectrometer had 6 particle detectors – 5 C-shaped channeltron photon –multipliers consisting of glass capillary tubes of 1 millimeter diameter, 10 centimeters long; and 1 helical funneltron photon-multiplier with an 8 millimeter opening.

    Particles of a given charge and different energies entering the spectrometer were subject to varying voltages and deflected toward the five photon-multipliers, while particles of the opposite charge were deflected to the funneltron photon-multiplier. Electrons and photons were thus measured simultaneously at five different energy levels.

    The CPLEE was deployed 3 meters north east of  Apollo 14’s central station. Results showed there are low energy photo-electrons during the day, with large changes in the solar wind flux. The unexpected was the detection of electrons with terrestrial aurorae band energies in the Earth’s magnetospheric tail.
