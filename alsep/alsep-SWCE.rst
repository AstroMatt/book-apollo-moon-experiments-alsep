Opis eksperymentu
=================
The Solar Wind Composition Experiment (SWC) was used to determine the elemental and isotopic composition of the noble gasses (helium, neon, and argon) in the solar wind. It was a simple experiment that used a sheet of 0.5 mm thick aluminium foil to trap individual particles of the solar wind to a depth of several hundred atomic layers, but allowed cosmic rays to pass through. The astronauts put the screens out on arrival and brought the foil back to Earth for analysis by Swiss scientists.

The Solar Wind Composition Experiment (SWCE), an aluminum foil panel, similar to household foil, that collected atomic particles released by the Sun into space was provided by scientists from Switzerland.  During Apollo 11 it was deployed and exposed for 1 hour 17 minutes and returned to Earth by the Apollo 11 crew for analysis by the Swiss experiment team.
