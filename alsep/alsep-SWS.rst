    The solar wind is composed of matter ejected continuously from the Sun that spreads throughout the Solar System. The energy, density, direction of travel, and its variations were measured by the SWS. Seven sensors were located under dust shields, allowing a study of the solar wind at the lunar surface, the general properties of the solar wind and its interaction with the Moon. The solar wind stretches the Earth’s magnetic field out behind the Earth, beyond the Moon’s orbit, so the SWS also studied the Earth’s magnetic tail when the Moon passed through it.

    The Apollo 12 SWS surprised the scientists by continuing to send data after the Sun had set. Dr Conway Snyder of JPL said, "The spectrometer didn't quit sending data – it continued to send back information on protons and even photo electrons several minutes after the Sun had stopped shining on it." He suspected the protons were sneaking around the edge of the Moon.

    The SWS found the solar wind behaved the same as in free space outside the Earth’s magnetic tail and is slightly disturbed in the geomagnetic transition region. The surprise was the detection of a gas cloud from the Apollo 13 Saturn-IV impact.

    The Solar Wind Spectrometer will measure the strength, velocity and directions of the electrons and protons which emanate from the Sun and reach the lunar surface. The solar wind is the major external force working on the Moon's surface. The spectrometer measurements will help interpret the magnetic field of the Moon, the lunar atmosphere and the analysis of lunar samples.

    Knowledge of the solar wind will help us understand the origin of the Sun and the physical processes at work on the Sun, i.e., the creation and acceleration of these particles and how they propagate through interplanetary space.

    It has been calculated that the solar wind puts one kiloton of energy into the Earth's magnetic field every second. This enormous amount of energy influences such Earth's processes as the aurora, ionosphere and weather. Although it requires twenty minutes for a kiloton to strike the Moon its effects should be apparent in m any w ays.

    In addition to the Solar Wind Spectrometer, an independent experiment (the Solar Wind Composition Experiment) will collect the gases of the solar wind for return to Earth for analysis.

    The design of the spectrometer and the subsequent data analysis are the responsibility of Dr. Conway Snyder, Dr. Douglas Clay and Dr. Marcia Neugebauer of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

    Seven identical modified Faraday cups (an instrument that traps ionized particles) are used to detect and collect solar wind electrons and protons. One cup is to the vertical, where- as the remaining six cups surround the vertical where the angle between the normals of any two adjacent cups is approximately 60 degrees. Each cup measures the current produced by the charged particle flux entering into it. Since the dups are identical, and if the particle flux is equal in each direction, equal current will be produced in each cup. If the flux is not equal in each direction, analysis of the amount of current in the seven cups will determine the variation of particle flow with direction. Also, by successively changing the voltages on the grid of the cup and measuring the corresponding current, complete energy spectra of both electrons and protons in the solar wind are produced.

    Data from each cup is processed in the ALSEP data subsystem. The measurement cycle is organized into 16 sequences of 186 ten-bit words. The instrument weighs 12.5 pounds, has an input voltage of about 28.5 volts and has an average input power of about 3.2 watts. The measurement ranges are as follows:

    Electrons
        High gain modulation        10.5 - 1376 eV (electron volts)
        Low gain modulation         6.2 - 817 eV

    Protons
        High gain modulation        75 - 9600 eV
        Low gain modulation         45 - 5700 eV

    Field of View                   6.0 Steradians
    Angular Resolution              15° (approximately)
    Minimum Flux Detectable         106 particles/cm2/sec
