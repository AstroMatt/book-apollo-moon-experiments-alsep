    NASA photo S70-56721 shows the Apollo 14 LPM in a lab setting. The electronics box in the foreground included setting switches and three output dials and was attached to the Modular Equipment Transporter (MET or handcart). The sensor head was fitted onto the tripod, which was deployed 15 meters or so away from the MET during readings. A similar instrument was flown on Apollo 16, with the electronics box fitted to the back of the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV). NASA photo AS14-68-9393a shows the deployed Apollo 14 instrument. Ed Mitchell took this documentation photo while standing at the MET waiting for a measurement to finish. Źródło: :cite:`Lindsay2008`.


Opis eksperymentu
=================
* carried on the MET

In addition to the ALSEP’s LSM, a portable Magnetometer (LPM) was taken on Apollo 14 and 16. Its purpose was different. It was carried with the astronauts on the traverses and used to measure the Moon's magnetic field at several different spots. This technique of mapping differences in the magnetic field from place to place is a standard one on Earth and is used extensively in prospecting. Many ore bodies cause anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field. Thus, if at a particular place we expect the magnetic field to be 40,000 nT and it is 36,000 nT, then the anomaly is 4,000 nT. On the Earth, anomalies of several thousand nanoteslas are common. Not so on the Moon. The total magnetic field of the Earth is about 50,000 nT. Because the Moon's magnetic field is only about one-thousandth that of the Earth's field, the magnetic anomalies are much smaller. The range of the Portable Instrument is 256 nT.

An LPM was carried on the Apollo 14 mission. Unfortunately only two measurements were obtained then. Both were startling. The first, taken near the landing point (but out of the LM's magnetic field) was about 43 nT. The second was taken on Cone Crater. It was 103 nT. These values were startling for two reasons. First, they were much larger than expected beforehand. Previous satellite measurements had obtained an unequivocal indication that the average value for the magnetic field at the surface of the Moon could not be larger than 10 to 12 nT. Yet these values were much larger. The difference in the two values, 60 nT, was equally startling. Such large changes had not been expected to occur over a short distance. In order to help understand the rapid change with distance, several measurements were taken on Apollo 16. These changes with distance are almost surely caused by the natural magnetization of the lunar rocks.

Natural magnetization has been known in terrestrial rocks for many years. The term lodestone is the name used for a naturally occurring magnet. The material of lodestone is magnetite, a strongly magnetic mineral. There are, of course, other magnetic minerals but magnetite is the most common. It also occurs in lunar rocks.

The sensors were contained in a box mounted on a tripod. They were connected to an electronics box on the Rover by a 15.2 meter flat ribbon electrical cable. In use, the tripod was set about 15 meters from the Rover. It had to be oriented with the shadow of the Sun and levelled. The astronaut then returned to the Rover to read the instrument. There were three digital panel meters resembling digital clocks, one for each axis. These meters indicated the size of the three components of the Moon's magnetic field. The astronaut reported the readings over the voice communications link with Earth.

The tripod had to be erected a good distance from the Rover because of the inherent magnetism of the vehicle and the astronaut. So for the actual measurement, the sensors were set away from both the astronaut and the Rover.
