=================

The scientific objective, of the Lunar Atmosphere Detector is to measure the density, temperature, and the changes in the lunar atmosphere. The LAD basically measures the total pressure of neutral (inactive) particles whereas the Ionosphere Detector measures composition of the ionized (active) particles. The densities are expected to build up on the sunlit side and to fall off on the dark side of the Moon. These measurements are expected to contribute to understanding of the processes which shape the lunar surface. The erosional features,recognized from the Apollo II soil samples, are produced by forces which are not similar to processes known on Earth.

The design of the experiment and the subsequent data analysis are the responsibility of Dr. Francis Johnson, Southwest Center for Advanced Studies and Mr. Dallas Evans, NASA Manned Spacecraft Center.
The lunar atmosphere detector consists of a cold cathode
ion gauge assembly, electronics package, and structural and thermal housings. The neutral particles are ionized and collected by the cathode, which is one of a pair of sensor electrodes,
and produce a current at the input circuitry of the electronics proportional to the particle density. This signal is amplified and processed by the electronics for transmission through the central station back to Earth. The gauge temperature is measured directly and is inserted into the data handling circuitry.

Any one of seven different dynamic ranges may be selected, permitting detection of neutral atom densities ranging from
10E-6 torr to 10E-12. The desired sensitivity may be chosen fromEarthorbyinternal adjustm ents.
This experiment will give the particle density and temperature of the ambient lunar atmosphere, including any temporal variations either of a random character or associated with lunar local time or solar activity.

Instrument parameters are as follows:

    Gauge accuracy      ± 30% above 10E-10 torr
    Weight              ± 50% below 10E-10 torr
    Operating Power     2 watts
