    A tri-axis fluxgate magnetometer measured the variations of the magnetic field of the Moon with time. Because the magnetic field of the Moon can change in amplitude, frequency, and direction, the magnetometer measures the field in three directions with sensors located on the end of three small booms. The electronics were contained in a box at the base of the three booms. It could measure magnetic flux in nanoteslas (nT) in three ranges with a resolution of 0.2 nT:

    -100 to +100 nT
    -200 to +200 nT
    -400 to +400 nT

    Magnetic fields of the Earth and Moon have two parts; one that changes with time, and one that is steady. The part that changes with time is caused by travelling electromagnetic waves. The steady part of the Earth’s magnetic field, which affects the common compass, varies from 35,000nT at the equator to 60,000nT at the poles, whereas the lunar magnetic field is only about 6 to 100 nT gamma, most likely due to the presence of natural magnetism in lunar rocks inherited early in the Moon’s history, when the magnetic field was much stronger that it is today. The Lunar Orbiters data inferred there was a steady magnetic field of about 8 nT. The magnetometer also measured the variation in time of the magnetic field, caused by electromagnetic waves propagated from the Sun.

    The moon has no global magnetic field like the Earth because it no longer has an internal dynamo, so it was a surprise when magnetometers placed by Apollo astronauts on the surface detected a faint magnetic field, as large as hundreds of nanoteslas. When the scientists built an electron detector that flew in lunar orbit aboard Apollo 15 in 1971 and Apollo 16 in 1972, they quickly realized they could use the instrument to remotely map the magnetic fields on the surface. Though crude and covering only about 10 percent of the lunar surface, the measurements nevertheless indicated a correlation between meteor impact basins -- dark, roughly circular features on the face of the moon and strong magnetic fields on the diametrically opposite side of the moon.

    Theorists came up with an explanation for magnetic fields antipodal to impact basins not long after the Apollo measurements hinted at a correlation. When a large meteorite hits the moon, it and much of the local lunar surface is vaporized and thrown into space, forming a cloud of debris and gas larger than the moon itself. Because of the heat released in the collision, much of the gas is ionised plasma in which the atoms are stripped of one or more electrons.

    Such plasmas exclude magnetic fields, so as the cloud spread around the moon it pushed the moon's magnetic field in front of it. When the plasma cloud finally converged on the diametrically opposite side of the moon -- a mere five minutes after impact -- the squeezed magnetic field would be quite large.

    At the same time debris was falling back on the lunar surface, concentrated at the antipodal site also. If this debris dropped onto the surface during the time when the magnetic field was high, it could have undergone shock magnetization. When rock is shocked, as when hit with a hammer, it can suddenly lose its own magnetic field and acquire that of the surrounding region.

    Scientists think that the magnetism of the Moon's surface is left over from a time when the Moon's magnetic field was actively created by a dynamo within the lunar core, and that this remnant magnetism may gradually erode away. Theories also suggest that the Moon's magnetism may come from collisions with other celestial bodies such as asteroids and comets, which might have imparted to the Moon some magnetic properties.

    The LSM measured a steady 38 nanoteslas (nT) at the Apollo 12 site, and 6 nT at the Apollo 15 site.

    The scientific objective of the magnetometer experiment is to measure the magnetic field at .the lunar surface. Charged particles and the magnetic field of the solar wind impact directly oa the lunar surface. Some of the solar wind particles are absorbed by the surface layer of the Moon. Others may be deflected around the Moon. The electrical properties of the material making up the Moon determine what happens to the magnetic field when it hits the Moon. If the Moon is a perfect insulator the magnetic field will pass through the Moon undisturbed. If there is material present which acts as a conductor, electric currents will flow in the Moon.

    Two possible models are shown in the next drawing. The electric current carried by the solar wind goes through the
    Moon and "closes" in the space surrounding the Moon, (figure a). This current (E) generates a magnetic field (M) as shown. The magnetic field carried in the solar wind will set up a system of electric currents in the Moon or along the surface. These currents will generate another magnetic field which tries to counteract the solar wind field, (figure b). This results in a change in the total magnetic field measured at the lunar surface.

    The magnitude of this difference can be determined by independently measuring the magnetic field in the undisturbed solar wind nearby, yet away from the Moon's surface. It is planned to obtain this data from Explorer 35, the unmanned spacecraft now in lunar orbit. The value of the magnetic field change at the Moon's surface can then be used to deduce information on the electrical properties of the Moon. This, in turn, can be used to better understand the internal temperature of the Moon and contribute to better understanding of the origin and history of the Moon.

    The design of the tri-axis flux-gate magnetometer and analysis of experiment data are the responsibility of Dr. Charles P. Sonett - NASA/Ames Research Center; Dr.' Jerry Modisette - NASA/Manned Spacecraft Center; and Dr. Palmer Dyal - NASA/Ames Research Center,

    The magnetometer consists of three magnetic sensors aligned in three orthogonal sensing axes, each located at the end of a fiberglass support arm extending from a central structure. This structure houses both the experiment electronics and the electro-mechanical gimbal/flip unit which allows the sensor to be pointed in any direction for site survey and calibration modes. The astronaut aligns the magnetometer experiment to within +3° East-West using a shadwograph on the central structure, and to within +3° of the vertical using a bubble level mounted on the Y sensor boom arm.

    Size, weight and power are as follows:
        Size (inches) deployed      40 high with 60 between sensor heads
        Weight (pounds)             17.5
        Peak Power Requirements (watts):

            Site Survey Mode 11.5
            Scientific Mode 6.2 12.3 (night)
            Calibration Mode 10.8

    The magnetometer experiment operates in three modes:

        Site Survey Mode - An initial site survey is performed in each of the three sensing modes for the purpose of locating and identifying any magnetic influences permanently inherent in the deployment site so that they will not affect the interpretation of the ME sensing of magnetic flux at the lunar surface. Although no measurable lunar magnetic field has been detected to date, the possibility of localized magnetism remains; thus this precaution must be taken.

        Scientific Mode - This is the normal operating mode wherein the strength and direction of the lunar magnetic field are measured continuously. The three magnetic sensors provide signal outputs proportional to the incidence of magnetic field components parallel to their respective axes. Each sensor will record the intensity three times per second which is faster than the magnetic field is expected to change. All sensors have the capability to sense over any one of three dynamic ranges with a resolution of 0.2 gamma (*):

        -100 to +100 gamma
        -200 to +200 gamma
        -400 to +400 gamma

        (*) Gamma is a unit of intensity of a magnetic field. The Earth at the equator, for example, is 35,000 gamma. The interplanetary magnetic field from the Sun has been recorded at 5 to 10 gamma.

        Calibration Mode - This is performed automatically at 12- hour intervals to determine the absolute accuracy of the magnetometer sensors and to correct any drift from their laboratory calibration.
