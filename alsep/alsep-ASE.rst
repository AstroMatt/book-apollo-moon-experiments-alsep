The Active Seismic Experiment was complementary to the Passive Seismic Experiment in two ways, scale and source of energy. The Passive Experiment was designed to study the whole Moon; the Active Experiment to study the local area. Rather than wait passively for natural events to occur on the Moon to produce shock waves, the Active Experiment provided its own sources. The shock waves are produced by explosions on the lunar surface. Two different kinds are used, small ones made while the astronauts are on the surface and large ones after they left the site and returned to the Earth.

The different kinds of sources for the Active Experiment were a "thumper" and a "mortar."  The thumper was used by the astronaut to explode ''shotgun-like'' charges. The thumper contained 19 such charges. It was fired at evenly spaced intervals along the geophone line. The results from this part of the experiment were available while the astronauts were still on the surface of the Moon.

The second kind of charge was similar to that of a mortar. In fact, the unit that fired these charges was referred to as a mortar package assembly. It contained four grenades that were launched using self-contained rockets sometime after the astronauts had left the Moon. The astronauts aligned the mortar launcher and armed it for firing. This unit contained geophones for measuring the velocity of each grenade on launch and the exact time of launch. Each grenade contained a rocket motor, a high explosive charge, provisions for igniting the rocket and a device to detonate the charge, a battery, a transmitter that provided information as to the length of time of the flight and the moment of impact on the Moon, and a thread with which to measure the distance of the impact from the launcher. Because there is no atmosphere on the Moon, the thin thread trailing the grenade remained taut and measured accurately the horizontal distance from the point of launch to the point of impact. They had been designed to impact the Moon at distances of 137, 282, 853, 1372 meters from the launcher. The size of the explosive charge increased with distance. Any layering in the Moon that is present in the first 300 meters beneath the surface would be seen with the Active Experiment.

Two experiments, the Active Seismic Experiment on Apollo 14 and 16 and the Lunar Seismic Profiling Experiment on Apollo 17, were performed to determine the detailed structure of the upper kilometer of the lunar crust. Both experiments involved detonation of a series of small explosives. The seismic waves, or ground vibrations, caused by these explosions were measured by a network of geophones (a kind of electronic stethoscope). On Apollo 14 and 16, up to 19 small explosions were detonated by an astronaut using a device called a "thumper" along a 90-meter-long geophone line. On Apollo 16, three mortar shells were also used to lob explosive charges to distances of up to 1,300 meters from the ALSEP.

Both the Apollo 16 mortar shells and the Apollo 17 explosives were detonated by radio control after the astronauts left the lunar surface.

These experiments showed that the lunar seismic velocity is between 0.1 and 0.3 kilometers per second in the upper few hundred meters of the crust at all three landing sites, which agrees closely with the passive data. These velocities are much lower than observed for intact rock on Earth, but are consistent with a highly fractured or brecciated material produced by the prolonged meteoritic bombardment of the Moon. At the Apollo 14 site there was a regolith surface layer of 8.5 meters. At the Apollo 17 landing site, the surface basalt layer was determined to have a thickness of 1.4 kilometers, slightly higher than the 1 kilometer thickness determined from the Traverse Gravimeter Experiment.
